## Next.js Dashboard Course

This is a repo to practice how to setup playwrite in a next application.

I'm using [Dashboard tutorial of the Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app) as a base.
My step by step of the dashboard tutorial can be seen at [this repository](https://github.com/AdrianaSaty/nextjs-dashboard-tutorial)

## Setup

After you have cloned this repo, install the dependencies with:

npm install

Then you can then start the application running:

npm run dev

That's it. Just Access http://localhost:3000/dashboard in your browser.

To login you can use:

- email: user@nextmail.com
- password: 123456
